# Story 1.3: Vietnamese Voice Synthesis & Output

## Status
Draft

## Story
As a user,
I want to receive clear, warm-sounding Vietnamese voice responses,
so that I feel comfortable and understood during my numerology consultation.

## Context
This story implements text-to-speech (TTS) for the backend-generated numerology insights, completing the voice I/O loop started in Story 1.2. Users will now hear the voicebot's responses in natural Vietnamese with warm, empathetic tone. This is critical for the voice-first interaction paradigm and essential for MVP user testing.

**Epic:** 1 - Foundation & Core Voice Infrastructure
**Priority:** P0 - Blocking
**Story Points:** 8
**Depends On:** Story 1.1 (completed), Story 1.2 (completed)
**Enables:** Story 1.5 (Voice-Numerology Flow), Story 2.1 (Conversation Intelligence)

## Acceptance Criteria

1. **Vietnamese Text-to-Speech Integration Working**
   - Azure Speech Services (Cognitive Services) Text-to-Speech integrated and authenticated [Source: architecture.md]
   - Real-time TTS streaming for response playback
   - Vietnamese language model (vi-VN) configured with warm voice profile
   - Response audio generation within 2 seconds of text completion

2. **Voice Response Playback with Controls**
   - Response audio plays automatically after generation
   - Pause/resume playback control visible
   - Replay button to listen to response again
   - Volume adjustment slider (0-100%)
   - Clear audio progress indicator showing playback position

3. **Natural Language Pronunciation & Tone**
   - Vietnamese tones (6 tones) pronounced correctly
   - Numbers and dates spoken naturally in Vietnamese
   - Proper stress and intonation for common Vietnamese phrases
   - Warm, empathetic vocal tone modulation for numerology context
   - No robotic or artificial-sounding synthesis

4. **Latency & Performance Requirements**
   - Text-to-speech generation completes within 2 seconds
   - Playback starts within 500ms of generation completion
   - No blocking of UI during audio generation
   - Smooth audio playback without gaps or stuttering
   - Memory-efficient audio streaming for extended conversations

5. **Error Handling & Fallback**
   - Graceful handling of TTS service failures
   - Display Vietnamese error messages for user-facing errors
   - Fallback to text-only display if audio unavailable
   - Retry mechanism for failed TTS requests
   - Network timeout handling (>5 seconds)

6. **Audio Output Integration**
   - Response text display alongside audio playback
   - Audio controls positioned logically in UI
   - Visual indicator showing audio is playing
   - Silent mode support (respects device mute switch)
   - Haptic feedback for playback state changes

### Azure Speech Services Text-to-Speech Setup
[Source: docs/architecture.md - Text-to-Speech Service]
**Configuration needed:**
- Same Azure subscription as STT (from Story 1.2)
- Region: `southeastasia` (Southeast Asia for Vietnamese users)
- Voice profiles for warm, empathetic tone:
  - Primary: `vi-VN-HoaiNeural` (Warm, friendly female voice) OR
  - Alternative: `vi-VN-ThanhNeural` (Warm, conversational male voice)
- Audio format: PCM 16-bit mono, 16kHz sample rate (for consistency with STT)
- SSML (Speech Synthesis Markup Language) support for:
  - Pitch control for emotional modulation
  - Speed adjustment for natural pacing
  - Emphasis and stress markers
- Streaming synthesis via REST API with chunked response

### API Contract
Backend TTS response structure:
```typescript
interface TextToSpeechRequest {
  text: string;
  voiceProfile?: 'hoai' | 'thanh'; // Vietnamese warm voices
  speed?: number; // 0.5 to 2.0, default 1.0
  pitch?: number; // -20 to +20 semitones, default 0
}

interface TextToSpeechResponse {
  audioBase64: string; // Base64-encoded WAV audio
  duration: number; // milliseconds
  textTokens: number; // input text token count
  audioContentType: string; // 'audio/wav'
}

interface PlaybackState {
  isPlaying: boolean;
  isPaused: boolean;
  currentTime: number; // seconds
  duration: number; // seconds
  volume: number; // 0-100
  error?: string;
}
```

- Error mapping to Vietnamese messages

**Integration Tests:**
- TTS request → response generation → playback flow
- Error handling scenarios (network timeout, API error)
- Playback state updates trigger UI updates
- Multiple audio playback in single session

**Manual Testing:**
- Generate TTS from various numerology interpretations
- Verify warm, empathetic tone in voice
- Test pause/resume/replay at different positions
- Test volume and speed adjustments
- Test on quiet and noisy environments
- Verify natural Vietnamese pronunciation
- Test device mute switch behavior
- Check memory usage for long audio playback
- Test with different device OS versions

**Performance Testing:**
- TTS generation time <2 seconds
- Playback start within 500ms of generation
- No UI blocking during audio generation
- Memory efficiency for extended conversations
- CPU usage during playback
