# Story 1.3: Vietnamese Voice Synthesis & Output

## Status
Ready for Review

## Story
As a user,
I want to receive clear, warm-sounding Vietnamese voice responses,
so that I feel comfortable and understood during my numerology consultation.

## Context
This story implements text-to-speech (TTS) for the backend-generated numerology insights, completing the voice I/O loop started in Story 1.2. Users will now hear the voicebot's responses in natural Vietnamese with warm, empathetic tone. This is critical for the voice-first interaction paradigm and essential for MVP user testing.

**Epic:** 1 - Foundation & Core Voice Infrastructure
**Priority:** P0 - Blocking
**Story Points:** 8
**Depends On:** Story 1.1 (completed), Story 1.2 (completed)
**Enables:** Story 1.5 (Voice-Numerology Flow), Story 2.1 (Conversation Intelligence)

## Acceptance Criteria

1. **Vietnamese Text-to-Speech Integration Working**
   - ElevenLabs Text-to-Speech API integrated and authenticated [Source: architecture.md - Text-to-Speech Service]
   - Real-time TTS streaming for response playback with natural voice synthesis
   - Vietnamese warm voice profile configured for empathetic tone
   - Response audio generation within 2 seconds of text completion

2. **Voice Response Playback with Controls**
   - Response audio plays automatically after generation
   - Pause/resume playback control visible
   - Replay button to listen to response again
   - Volume adjustment slider (0-100%)
   - Clear audio progress indicator showing playback position

3. **Natural Language Pronunciation & Tone**
   - Vietnamese tones (6 tones) pronounced correctly
   - Numbers and dates spoken naturally in Vietnamese
   - Proper stress and intonation for common Vietnamese phrases
   - Warm, empathetic vocal tone modulation for numerology context
   - No robotic or artificial-sounding synthesis

4. **Latency & Performance Requirements**
   - Text-to-speech generation completes within 2 seconds
   - Playback starts within 500ms of generation completion
   - No blocking of UI during audio generation
   - Smooth audio playback without gaps or stuttering
   - Memory-efficient audio streaming for extended conversations

5. **Error Handling & Fallback**
   - Graceful handling of TTS service failures
   - Display Vietnamese error messages for user-facing errors
   - Fallback to text-only display if audio unavailable
   - Retry mechanism for failed TTS requests
   - Network timeout handling (>5 seconds)

6. **Audio Output Integration**
   - Response text display alongside audio playback
   - Audio controls positioned logically in UI
   - Visual indicator showing audio is playing
   - Silent mode support (respects device mute switch)
   - Haptic feedback for playback state changes

- API key from ElevenLabs dashboard (stored in `.env` as `ELEVENLABS_API_KEY`)
- Region: Global access (ElevenLabs CDN-optimized)
- Voice profiles for warm, empathetic tone:
  - Primary: Warm Vietnamese voice (specific voice_id TBD after testing ElevenLabs catalog)
  - Alternative voice options from ElevenLabs multilingual voice library
- Audio format: MP3 or WAV, 16kHz sample rate for quality

  emotionalTone?: 'neutral' | 'warm' | 'empathetic'; // For SSML modulation
  speed?: number; // 0.5 to 2.0, default 1.0
  stability?: number; // 0-1, higher = more consistent (default 0.5)
}

interface TextToSpeechResponse {
  audioUrl: string; // Azure Blob Storage URL or direct stream
  audioBase64?: string; // Optional: Base64-encoded MP3 audio
  duration: number; // milliseconds
  textTokens: number; // input text token count

- Audio playback service (play/pause/resume/stop logic)
- Zustand store (state transitions and actions)
- Error mapping to Vietnamese messages

**Integration Tests:**
- TTS request → response generation → playback flow
- Error handling scenarios (network timeout, API error)
- Playback state updates trigger UI updates
- Multiple audio playback in single session

**Manual Testing:**
- Generate TTS from various numerology interpretations
- Verify warm, empathetic tone in voice
- Test pause/resume/replay at different positions
- Test volume and speed adjustments
- Test on quiet and noisy environments
- Verify natural Vietnamese pronunciation
- Test device mute switch behavior
- Check memory usage for long audio playback
- Test with different device OS versions

**Performance Testing:**
- TTS generation time <2 seconds
- Playback start within 500ms of generation
- No UI blocking during audio generation
- Memory efficiency for extended conversations
- CPU usage during playback
