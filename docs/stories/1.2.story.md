# Story 1.2: Voice Input & Speech Recognition Integration

## Status
Draft

## Story
As a user,
I want to speak Vietnamese into the app and see my words accurately transcribed,
so that I can naturally communicate with the numerology voicebot.

## Context
This story implements the first half of voice interaction - capturing and transcribing user speech. It builds on the infrastructure from Story 1.1 and is the critical path for MVP. Successful speech-to-text is essential for the voice-first interaction paradigm.

**Epic:** 1 - Foundation & Core Voice Infrastructure
**Priority:** P0 - Blocking
**Story Points:** 8
**Depends On:** Story 1.1 (completed)
**Enables:** Story 1.3 (Voice Synthesis), Story 1.5 (Voice-Numerology Flow)

## Acceptance Criteria

1. **Vietnamese Speech-to-Text Integration Working**
   - Google Cloud Speech-to-Text API integrated and authenticated
   - Real-time transcription processing audio streams
   - Vietnamese language model (vi-VN) configured correctly
   - Transcription results returned within 2 seconds for typical speech

2. **Voice Activation Button with Visual Feedback**
   - Button component visible on conversation screen
   - Visual state changes (idle → listening → processing)
   - Animated waveform visualization during recording
   - Haptic feedback on button press (iOS/Android)
   - Clear feedback when voice recording starts/stops

3. **Transcribed Text Display with Editing**
   - Transcribed text displayed above input field
   - User can edit/correct transcribed text before sending
   - Text selection and cursor positioning working correctly
   - Clear and readable UI following design standards

4. **Network Error Handling**
   - Graceful handling of no-internet scenarios
   - User-friendly Vietnamese error messages
   - Retry mechanism for failed transcriptions
   - Offline mode preventing voice input (clear messaging)
   - Timeout handling for slow connections (>5 seconds)

5. **Speech Recognition Accuracy >95%**
   - Testing with various Vietnamese speaker accents
   - Minimal failures on standard Vietnamese speech
   - Proper handling of Vietnamese tones (6 tones)
   - Numbers, dates, and common phrases recognized correctly

6. **Basic Conversation Flow**
   - Multiple voice inputs per session working
   - Each transcription added to message history
   - Message history cleared on new conversation
   - Session context maintained across inputs
   - Clear visual indication of message sequence

- Utilities (error formatting, Vietnamese messages)

**Integration Tests:**
- Record → Transcribe → Display flow
- Error handling scenarios (network timeout, API error)
- State updates trigger UI updates
- Multiple recordings in single session

**Manual Testing:**
