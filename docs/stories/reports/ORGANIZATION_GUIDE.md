# Report Organization & Structure Guide

Clean, well-organized storage for all story development reports.

## ✅ What Was Done

All story reports have been reorganized into a clean, hierarchical structure under `docs/stories/reports/`.

### Before (❌ Messy)
```
numerologist/
├── STORY_1.2c_IMPLEMENTATION_COMPLETE.md
├── STORY_1.2c_VALIDATION_REPORT.md
├── STORY_1.2b_COMPATIBILITY_REPORT.md
└── [other root files]
```

### After (✅ Clean)
```
numerologist/
└── docs/stories/reports/
    ├── INDEX.md                              # Master index
    ├── README.md                             # Directory guide
    ├── ORGANIZATION_GUIDE.md                 # This file
    ├── 1.2b-compatibility-report.md
    ├── 1.2c-implementation-complete.md
    └── 1.2c-validation-report.md
```

## 📋 Current Reports

| Report | Size | Type | Purpose |
|--------|------|------|---------|
| `1.2b-compatibility-report.md` | 25.7 KB | Compatibility | Pre-dev architecture review |
| `1.2c-implementation-complete.md` | 19.9 KB | Implementation | Story completion summary |
| `1.2c-validation-report.md` | 19.6 KB | Validation | Acceptance criteria verification |

## 🏷️ Naming Convention

**Format:** `{story-id}-{report-type}.md`

**Examples:**
- ✅ `1.2c-implementation-complete.md`
- ✅ `1.2b-compatibility-report.md`
- ✅ `1.3a-validation-report.md`

**Avoid:**
- ❌ `STORY_1.2c_IMPLEMENTATION_COMPLETE.md`
- ❌ `Story1.2c_Report.md`
- ❌ `1_2_c_implementation.md`

**Story ID Format:**
- Minor stories: `1.2a`, `1.2b`, `1.2c` (epic.story.substory)
- Major stories: `1.3`, `1.4`, `1.5` (epic.story)

## 📚 Report Types

### 1. Compatibility Report
**File:** `{story-id}-compatibility-report.md`
**Created:** Before development (sprint planning phase)
**Updated:** Only if dependencies change

**Sections:**
- Executive summary with compatibility score
- Tech stack alignment analysis
- Prerequisites verification
- Dependency analysis
- Identified blockers/risks
- Go/no-go recommendation

**Example:** `1.2b-compatibility-report.md`

### 2. Implementation Complete
**File:** `{story-id}-implementation-complete.md`
**Created:** After all code is written
**Updated:** Before PR merge (final checklist)

**Sections:**
- Executive summary with key metrics
- Files created/modified with LOC
- Feature implementation details
- Acceptance criteria verification
- Code quality checklist
- Testing summary
- Definition of Done
- Post-implementation tasks

**Example:** `1.2c-implementation-complete.md`

### 3. Validation Report
**File:** `{story-id}-validation-report.md`
**Created:** During QA/review phase
**Updated:** Until all criteria verified

**Sections:**
- Acceptance criteria matrix
- Feature-by-feature breakdown
- Test results summary
- Performance metrics
- Known limitations
- Sign-off checklist

**Example:** `1.2c-validation-report.md`

## 🎯 Usage Guidelines

### For Sprint Planners
1. Check `INDEX.md` for story overview
2. Read compatibility report
3. Review any identified blockers
4. Approve for sprint or defer

### For Developers
1. Reference compatibility report for architecture context
2. Use implementation report as development guide
3. Follow file list and acceptance criteria
4. Update report before submitting PR

### For QA/Reviewers
1. Read validation report
2. Verify all acceptance criteria checked ✅
3. Cross-check with implementation report
4. Sign off when complete

### For Documentation
1. Search reports for implementation details
2. Extract file locations and architecture
3. Link to reports from API docs
4. Reference in design documentation

## 📊 Quick Stats

- `INDEX.md` - Quick access master index
- `README.md` - Complete directory guide
- `../1.2a.story.md` - Original story file
- `../1.2b.story.md` - Original story file
- `../1.2c.story.md` - Original story file

## 🚀 Best Practices Going Forward

### ✅ DO
- Create reports in `docs/stories/reports/`
- Use consistent naming convention
- Update `INDEX.md` with new reports
- Cross-reference between reports
- Include actual file paths and metrics
- Link to source code examples

### ❌ DON'T
- Create root-level report files
- Use uppercase filenames
- Duplicate information across reports
- Leave reports outdated
- Create multiple reports for same story+type
- Use unclear naming schemes

## 🔄 Workflow Example

When developing Story 1.3a:

1. **Compatibility Phase**
   - Create `1.3a-compatibility-report.md`
   - Add to `INDEX.md`
   - Get approval before starting dev

2. **Development Phase**
   - Reference compatibility report
   - Update as you implement
   - Track files and LOC

3. **Completion Phase**
   - Create `1.3a-implementation-complete.md`
   - Update `INDEX.md`
   - Submit for review

4. **QA/Review Phase**
   - Create `1.3a-validation-report.md`
   - Verify all criteria
   - Update `INDEX.md`
   - Sign off

## 📞 Questions?

1. Check `INDEX.md` for report locations
2. Read `README.md` for detailed guide
3. Reference this document for workflow
4. Look at existing reports for examples (1.2b, 1.2c)
