# Story Reports & Documentation

Organized reports for story development, validation, and compatibility reviews.

## Organization

Story reports are organized by story ID and report type:
- `{story-id}-implementation-complete.md` - Implementation summary and completion checklist
- `{story-id}-validation-report.md` - Acceptance criteria validation
- `{story-id}-compatibility-report.md` - Pre-development architecture review

## Story 1.2a: Backend Conversation Service Infrastructure

| Report | Status | Purpose |
|--------|--------|---------|
| 1.2a-implementation-complete.md | âœ… Complete | Implementation summary (pending upload) |
| 1.2a-compatibility-report.md | âœ… Approved | Architecture compatibility (pending upload) |

## Story 1.2b: Fix React Version Conflicts in Mobile Frontend

| Report | Status | Purpose |
|--------|--------|---------|
| [1.2b-compatibility-report.md](./1.2b-compatibility-report.md) | âœ… Approved | Pre-development compatibility review |

**Key Finding:** Story correctly identifies React version skew between mobile (RN 0.81.4) and libs/ui (RN 0.73.11). Story is ready for development with no blockers.

## How to Use These Reports

**For Sprint Planning:**
- Check compatibility reports before adding stories to sprint
- Look for "Approved for Development" status
- Review identified blockers if any

**For Development:**
- Reference implementation reports for patterns and examples
- Use acceptance criteria checklist as development guide
- Check post-implementation tasks for cleanup

**For QA/Review:**
- Use validation reports to verify all criteria met
- Reference file lists to ensure all changes are present
- Check testing coverage for test execution

**For Documentation:**
- Link to relevant implementation reports in API docs
- Reference architecture decisions in design docs
- Use for onboarding new team members
