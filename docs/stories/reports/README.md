## 📋 Report Types

### Implementation Complete (`{story-id}-implementation-complete.md`)
**When Created:** After story development is finished

**Contains:**
- Executive summary with key metrics
- Complete file list with line counts
- Feature implementation details by component
- Acceptance criteria verification (all should be checked ✅)
- Code quality checklist
- Testing summary
- Definition of Done verification
- Post-implementation tasks

**Example:** `1.2c-implementation-complete.md` (Story 1.2c delivered)

### Compatibility Report (`{story-id}-compatibility-report.md`)
**When Created:** Before development starts (part of sprint planning)

**Contains:**
- Compatibility score (0-100)
- Tech stack alignment analysis
- Prerequisites verification
- Dependency impact analysis
- Identified blockers/risks with recommendations
- Go/no-go recommendation for development
- Technical debt assessment
- Risk mitigation strategies

**Example:** `1.2b-compatibility-report.md` (Story 1.2b approved for dev)

### Validation Report (`{story-id}-validation-report.md`)
**When Created:** During QA/review phase

**Contains:**
- Acceptance criteria verification matrix
- Feature breakdown with test status
- Test coverage analysis
- Performance metrics (if applicable)
- Known limitations
- Edge case handling
- Integration verification
- Sign-off checklist

**Example:** `1.2c-validation-report.md` (Story 1.2c tested)

## 🔍 Quick Access Guide

### For Sprint Planners
```
1. Open docs/stories/reports/INDEX.md
2. Find your story
3. Check compatibility report status
4. Review any identified blockers
5. Approve for sprint or defer
```

### For Developers
```
1. Find your story in docs/stories/reports/
2. Read compatibility report (architecture context)
3. Reference implementation report for patterns
4. Use acceptance criteria checklist as guide
5. Update file list as you implement
```

### For QA/Reviewers
```
1. Find story's validation report
2. Verify acceptance criteria (should all be ✅)
3. Cross-check with implementation report
4. Run test suite from testing summary
5. Sign off when all criteria met
```

### For Documentation
```
1. Search for story ID across reports
2. Find relevant implementation details
3. Extract file locations and architecture
4. Link to reports from API docs
5. Update related docs as needed
```

## 📊 Report Statistics

Each story report includes metrics like:
- **Lines of Code (LOC):** Backend + Frontend breakdown
- **Test Coverage:** Number and types of tests
- **Acceptance Criteria:** X/Y met
- **Files:** Number created/modified
- **Complexity Score:** Based on implementation scope

## 🏷️ Naming Convention

All reports follow consistent naming:

```
{story-id}-{report-type}.md

Examples:
✅ 1.2c-implementation-complete.md
✅ 1.2b-compatibility-report.md
✅ 1.2c-validation-report.md
❌ STORY_1.2c_IMPLEMENTATION_COMPLETE.md (avoid)
❌ Story1.2c_Report.md (avoid)
```

## 📝 How to Create a Report

### For Implementation Complete:
1. Create file: `docs/stories/reports/{story-id}-implementation-complete.md`
2. Copy template structure from existing report
3. Fill in all sections with actual data
4. Verify all acceptance criteria are addressed
5. Link from INDEX.md
6. Delete any root-level report files

### For Compatibility Review:
1. Run user-story-compatibility-reviewer agent
2. Save output to: `docs/stories/reports/{story-id}-compatibility-report.md`
3. Update INDEX.md with link and key findings
4. Delete any root-level report files

### For Validation Report:
1. Create file: `docs/stories/reports/{story-id}-validation-report.md`
2. Document test results and verifications
3. Check all acceptance criteria boxes
4. Include sign-off section
5. Link from INDEX.md

## 🔗 Cross-References

Reports can reference each other:
```markdown
See [Story 1.2c implementation](./1.2c-implementation-complete.md) for details on Daily.co integration.

See [Story 1.2b compatibility](./1.2b-compatibility-report.md) for React version alignment strategy.
```

## 📌 Important Notes

1. **One Report Per Story Per Type:** Don't create multiple implementation reports for the same story
2. **Keep Them Updated:** Update reports if story requirements change
3. **Link from Story File:** Reference reports in the story's Dev Agent Record section
4. **Archive Old Reports:** Move superseded reports to `_archive/` if needed
5. **Use Markdown:** Always use `.md` format for version control compatibility

## 🚀 Best Practices

- ✅ Keep reports focused and concise (but comprehensive)
- ✅ Use checklists for criteria verification
- ✅ Include actual file paths and line numbers
- ✅ Add code snippets to illustrate implementation
- ✅ Cross-reference related stories
- ✅ Update INDEX.md when adding new reports
- ❌ Don't create root-level documents (keep organized)
- ❌ Don't duplicate information across reports
- ❌ Don't leave reports outdated
