# Story 1.6 - Refactor Voice Services to Use Agent Framework & ElevenLabs Libraries

**Story ID:** 1.6  
**Epic:** Epic 1: Foundation & Core Voice Infrastructure  
**Status:** Ready for Review  
**Story Points:** 8 (Refactoring with library migration)  
**Priority:** High (Technical debt - replaces direct API calls with production libraries)

---

## Story

As a developer,
I want to refactor the existing direct Azure OpenAI and ElevenLabs API calls (from stories 1.2 and 1.3) to use the Microsoft Agent Framework and official ElevenLabs Python SDK,
so that voice interactions become more robust, maintainable, and production-ready with built-in error handling, streaming support, and observability.

---

## Context: Current Implementation (Stories 1.2 & 1.3)

### Current State - Direct API Calls
**Story 1.2 - Voice Input & Speech Recognition:**
- Currently uses `azure-cognitiveservices-speech` for STT directly
- Direct HTTP calls to Azure Speech API
- Manual error handling and retry logic
- No agent orchestration

**Story 1.3 - Vietnamese Voice Synthesis:**
- Currently makes direct REST calls to ElevenLabs API
- Manual streaming implementation
- No request stitching for voice consistency
- Basic error handling only

### Issues with Current Approach
1. **No Orchestration:** STT and TTS are isolated; no conversation context
2. **Manual Tool Management:** No way to invoke numerology tools during conversation
3. **Limited Streaming:** Manual implementation lacks request stitching
4. **No Observability:** Hard to trace execution and debug issues
5. **Repetitive Error Handling:** Each service implements its own retry logic
6. **No Thread Management:** Conversation history not automatically managed

---

## Refactoring Target: Library-Based Approach

### New Architecture
Use **Microsoft Agent Framework** as the orchestration layer:
- Wraps Azure OpenAI STT (gpt-4o-mini-transcribe) for speech recognition
- Orchestrates conversation logic with gpt-4o-mini for reasoning
- Integrates with **ElevenLabs Python SDK** for TTS with streaming

---

## Acceptance Criteria

### 1. Migrate Story 1.2 Voice Input to Agent Framework STT
- [ ] Replace direct Azure Speech API calls with Agent Framework's Azure OpenAI STT integration
- [ ] Update `apps/api/src/services/voice_service.py` to use `azure_openai_stt_deployment_name="gpt-4o-mini-transcribe"`
- [ ] Configure dual deployment strategy (separate STT and Reasoning deployments)
- [ ] Voice transcription still works with 95%+ accuracy for Vietnamese
- [ ] Update config.py with separate `azure_openai_stt_deployment_name` property
- [ ] All existing voice input tests pass without modification to test cases

### 2. Migrate Story 1.3 Voice Output to ElevenLabs Python SDK
- [ ] Replace direct REST calls to ElevenLabs with official `elevenlabs` Python SDK
- [ ] Update `apps/api/src/services/text_to_speech_service.py` to use ElevenLabs SDK
- [ ] Implement async streaming using SDK's built-in streaming support
- [ ] Add request stitching for voice consistency across multiple TTS calls
- [ ] Maintain latency requirement: TTS response < 1 second
- [ ] All existing voice output tests pass without modification

### 3. Implement Agent Framework Orchestration Layer
- [ ] Create `apps/api/src/services/agent_service.py` with Agent Framework client
- [ ] Initialize agent with Azure OpenAI configuration (both STT and Reasoning deployments)
- [ ] Implement agent with system instructions for numerology conversation
- [ ] Agent accepts voice input and produces voice output
- [ ] Agent maintains conversation threading for context

### 4. Update Configuration Management
- [ ] Add `azure_openai_stt_deployment_name` to config.py (defaults to "gpt-4o-mini-transcribe")
- [ ] Add `azure_openai_reasoning_deployment_name` to config.py (defaults to "gpt-4o-mini")
- [ ] Both deployment names loaded from environment variables
- [ ] .env.example updated with new deployment name variables
- [ ] Configuration validated at application startup

### 5. Update Dependencies
- [ ] Add `agent-framework>=1.0` to requirements.txt
- [ ] Update `elevenlabs>=0.3` (was already present)
- [ ] Remove direct Azure Speech SDK if no longer needed: `azure-cognitiveservices-speech`
- [ ] All imports work correctly without conflicts
- [ ] requirements.txt has accurate version pins

### 6. Error Handling & Fallbacks
- [ ] Agent Framework handles Azure OpenAI API errors with exponential backoff
- [ ] ElevenLabs SDK errors caught and logged properly
- [ ] User receives fallback messages in Vietnamese on TTS failure
- [ ] Agent retry logic works transparently
- [ ] No breaking changes to error responses sent to frontend

### 7. Observability & Logging
- [ ] Agent Framework execution traces visible in Azure Application Insights
- [ ] Agent tool invocations logged with inputs/outputs
- [ ] TTS streaming tracked and monitored
- [ ] Performance metrics recorded (latency breakdown by component)
- [ ] Debug logs available for troubleshooting

### 8. Testing - Backward Compatibility
- [ ] All unit tests for story 1.2 (voice input) still pass
- [ ] All unit tests for story 1.3 (voice output) still pass
- [ ] Integration tests verify complete voice flow still works
- [ ] Performance benchmarks: latency maintained or improved
- [ ] No breaking changes to API contracts

### 9. Testing - New Functionality
- [ ] Agent Framework client initializes successfully
- [ ] Agent accepts text queries and produces responses
- [ ] Agent tool system properly configured (ready for story 2.1)
- [ ] Request stitching in TTS maintains voice consistency
- [ ] Streaming works end-to-end

### 10. Documentation

## Dev Notes

### Technical Context from docs/architecture/tech-stack.md

**Microsoft Agent Framework vs Direct API Calls**
| Aspect | Direct APIs | Agent Framework |
|--------|-------------|-----------------|
| **Tool Management** | Manual function calls | Automatic tool invocation |
| **Error Handling** | Custom retry logic per service | Built-in exponential backoff |
| **Streaming** | Manual implementation | Built-in support |
| **Threading** | Must implement manually | Automatic conversation threads |
| **Observability** | Custom logging | OpenTelemetry integration |
| **Cost** | Same | Same (just wrappers) |
| **Performance** | Low overhead | Minimal overhead |

**Why Migrate to Libraries?**
1. **Production Ready:** Libraries handle edge cases and edge-case scenarios
2. **Maintainability:** Less custom code to maintain
3. **Observability:** Built-in tracing and monitoring
4. **Tool Integration:** Foundation for stories 2.1+ where agent uses numerology tools
5. **Future Scaling:** Easier to add new tools and capabilities

### Migration Path

**Before (Story 1.2 - Direct API):**
```python
# Story 1.2 - Direct Azure Speech API
from azure.cognitiveservices.speech import SpeechConfig, AudioConfig

def transcribe_voice(audio_bytes):
    config = SpeechConfig(subscription=AZURE_KEY, region="eastus2")
    # Manual streaming setup...
    return transcribed_text
```

**After (Story 1.6 - Agent Framework):**
```python
# Story 1.6 - Agent Framework STT
from agent_framework.azure import AzureOpenAIResponsesClient

agent_client = AzureOpenAIResponsesClient(api_key=key, endpoint=endpoint)
# STT handled internally via gpt-4o-mini-transcribe deployment
```

**Before (Story 1.3 - Direct ElevenLabs REST):**
```python
# Story 1.3 - Direct REST calls
import requests

def text_to_speech(text):
    response = requests.post(
        f"{ELEVENLABS_URL}/text-to-speech/{voice_id}",
        json={"text": text},
        headers={"xi-api-key": key}
    )
    return response.content
```

**After (Story 1.6 - ElevenLabs SDK):**
```python
# Story 1.6 - ElevenLabs Python SDK
from elevenlabs import ElevenLabs

client = ElevenLabs(api_key=key)
audio = client.text_to_speech.stream(
    text=text,
    voice_id=voice_id,
    previous_request_ids=request_ids  # Stitching!
)
```

### Project Structure Changes

**Files to Update:**
```
apps/api/src/
├── config.py                         # ADD: azure_openai_stt_deployment_name, azure_openai_reasoning_deployment_name
├── services/
│   ├── voice_service.py              # REFACTOR: Replace direct Azure Speech with Agent Framework
│   ├── text_to_speech_service.py     # REFACTOR: Replace direct REST with ElevenLabs SDK
│   └── agent_service.py              # NEW: Agent Framework orchestration
└── requirements.txt                  # ADD: agent-framework>=1.0; REMOVE: azure-cognitiveservices-speech
```

**Tests to Update:**
```
apps/api/tests/
├── test_voice_service.py             # Update: Mock Agent Framework instead of Azure Speech
├── test_tts_service.py               # Update: Mock ElevenLabs SDK instead of REST
└── test_voice_flow_integration.py    # NEW: Full voice flow with Agent Framework
```

### Configuration Changes

**apps/api/src/config.py - Add:**
```python
# Azure OpenAI - Separate deployments for STT and Reasoning
azure_openai_stt_deployment_name: str = "gpt-4o-mini-transcribe"
azure_openai_reasoning_deployment_name: str = "gpt-4o-mini"
```

**.env.example - Add:**
```bash
AZURE_OPENAI_STT_DEPLOYMENT_NAME=gpt-4o-mini-transcribe
AZURE_OPENAI_REASONING_DEPLOYMENT_NAME=gpt-4o-mini
```

### Dependencies Changes

**requirements.txt - Before:**
```
azure-cognitiveservices-speech==1.30.0
elevenlabs==0.2.0
```

**requirements.txt - After:**
```
agent-framework==1.0.0  # NEW
elevenlabs==0.3.0       # UPDATED
# azure-cognitiveservices-speech removed if not used elsewhere
```

### Breaking Changes (None Expected)

**API Compatibility:**
- Voice input endpoint remains the same
- Voice output remains the same format
- No breaking changes to frontend contracts

**Internal Changes:**
- Service implementations change, but interfaces stay the same
- Error messages might improve, but general error handling same
- Latency should stay the same or improve

### Performance Impact

**Expected Improvements:**
- STT: ~5-10% faster with gpt-4o-mini-transcribe (more optimized)
- TTS: ~10-15% faster with SDK streaming and request stitching
- Overall latency: < 3 seconds maintained or improved

**No Regressions Expected:**
- Libraries are wrappers around same APIs
- Error handling better (fewer edge cases missed)
- Cost identical (same underlying API calls)
