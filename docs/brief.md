# Project Brief: Numeroly

## 1. Executive Summary

**Numeroly** is a warm, friendly, and healing AI voicebot designed to help Vietnamese users explore themselves through **Pythagorean numerology**. The app allows users to **converse via voice**, receive personalized numerology insights, and get actionable advice based on their own energy cycles. The short-term goal is to build a **prototype demo** for market testing and fundraising.

## 2. Problem Statement

Vietnamese audiences are increasingly interested in self-awareness, mental wellness, and personal growth. However:

* Many current fortune-telling or numerology apps lack credibility or are purely for entertainment.
* There is a lack of **Vietnamese-language AI voice assistants** that provide empathy and personalized guidance.
* The market has high demand but no product that blends **AI + voice interaction + numerology-based guidance**.

---

## 3. Proposed Solution

Numeroly offers a **friendly AI voicebot** that applies Pythagorean numerology to:

* Analyze personal numbers (Life Path, Destiny, Soul, Personality, Personal Year/Month...)
* Chat like a **warm, empathetic companion**, helping users gain self-awareness.
* Provide **practical suggestions** based on the user’s personal energy cycle.
* Support natural Vietnamese voice input and output for smooth, emotional interaction.

## 7. Technical Considerations

| Component               | Suggested Technology                                    |
| ----------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------- |
| Voice Input             | Whisper API or Google Speech-to-Text                    |
| Voice Output            | ElevenLabs or OpenAI TTS                                |
| NLP & Numerology Engine | Python + GPT-4o mini (fine-tuned for Pythagorean logic) |
| Backend                 | FastAPI (Python)                                        |
| Frontend                | React Native or Flutter                                 |
| Database                | PostgreSQL (user data, numerology profiles, voice logs) |

## 8. Constraints & Assumptions

* **Limited budget**, prioritize prototype over full backend system.
* **Vietnamese voice generation** adapted from international AI models.
* **No live expert consultation** during the prototype phase.
* **All user data encrypted** and stored securely.

---

## 9. Risks & Open Questions

**Risks:**

* Linguistic and cultural nuances could lead to misinterpretation of numerology readings.
* Limited quality of natural Vietnamese AI voice synthesis.
* Emotional counseling requires careful sensitivity to avoid misunderstandings.

**Open Questions:**

* Should Numeroly position itself as a “spiritual app with scientific roots” or a “wellness & mental health tool”?
* Which voice persona style (warm, wise, or cheerful) resonates best with Vietnamese users?
* Should Numeroly expand into **AI-generated voice podcasts** based on numerology insights?

## 10. Next Steps

1. Design 3 key conversational UX flows for the voicebot.
2. Develop and complete MVP prototype within 6 weeks.
3. Conduct testing with 100 Vietnamese users (across age groups).
4. Gather feedback and fine-tune AI conversation tone and logic.
5. Prepare an investor pitch deck once the prototype is ready.
