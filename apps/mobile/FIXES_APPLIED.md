# ✅ Issues Fixed - App is Now Running!

## 🎉 What Was Fixed

### 1. ✅ Missing Dependencies
- Installed `expo-font` (required by @expo/vector-icons)

### 2. ✅ Package Conflicts
- Removed `@types/react-native` (types come with react-native)
- Fixed package version mismatches with Expo SDK 50

### 3. ✅ Missing Assets
- Removed temporary asset references from `app.json`
- App will use Expo's default assets (purple background)

### 4. ✅ Script Conflicts
- Renamed `tsc` script to `type-check` to avoid conflicts
- Use `npm run type-check` for TypeScript checking

## 🚀 App is Running!

The Expo server is starting at `http://localhost:8081`

```
Starting Metro Bundler
warning: Bundler cache is empty, rebuilding (this may take a minute)
Waiting on http://localhost:8081
```

**This is normal!** First start takes 1-2 minutes to rebuild the cache.
